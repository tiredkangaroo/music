## things i got to do

- mobile ui
- playlist image chooser to pick square out of the image
- api for what the user is listening to?? maybe.
- compact mode?
- get around youtube age restriction without using cookies? (ex. can't download from surfer rosa bc album cover)

- begin searching from psql and not spotify search api or both?
- maybe not direct dom manipulation when lyric is clicked?
