## things i got to do or should do (doesn't mean i'll do them though 😝)

- optimize downloads (quite vague ik)
- get around youtube age restriction without using cookies?
- update the download button status once downloaded or with loading icon
- when importing or downloading full playlist, maybe should show x/y tracks?
- compact mode?
- mobile ui
- maybe not direct dom manipulation when lyric is clicked?
